Description

This is a "Simple Stopwatch,"; Imagine you're crafting a sleek stopwatch app tailored for runners gearing up for their big race day. This project is the implement of that stopwatch.

Main purpose of this stop watch is to display the crucial metrics of time: minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, all in a sleek and user-friendly interface.

It include: 

🏁 Title (h1): A bold and inspiring header that sets the pace for the challenge ahead. The text should be "Simple Stopwatch".

⏱️ Timer (p): The beating heart of your stopwatch, ready to track every second of the race. The starting text should be "00:00:00".

🚀 Start, Stop, Reset, Lap Buttons: The control center for our runners, offering the power to kick off, pause, restart, and mark key moments in their journey.

🏃‍♂️ Reset - Ready, Set, Go Again! When the runners need a fresh start, they hit the reset button. This button sends our timer back to the starting line, ready for the next lap.

🏁 Lap - Keep Track of Your Progress! Every time the athletes complete a lap, they want to capture that moment. The lap functionality records these lapped times as a list item. Each press adds a new achievement to the list, showcasing their progress with each stride.
